git helps us to create repositories

Repository:- repository is a local machine or remote server where data is stored and maintained in an organized manner.

How git works?
git has three main states that your files or artifacts can reside in. 
1. Modified:-  modified means that your changed the artifact but have not committed it to the git database yet.

2. Staged:-  stage means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
					Snapshot means state of an artifact at any point of time. This is achieved by the git add command.

3. Committed:- committed means that the artifact such as the file data is safely stored in your local git database. This is achieved by the git commit command 

so we have three main sections of a project to working directly.This is the section where you work on your files.

For example, you might create a file and modified. Staging area. This is the section where the changes in artifact are marked for commit. It's sometimes referred to as the index. Commit area. Commit area is the most important part of git this is where committed files are stored.
The doc git directly is where git stores the committed artifacts and metadata for your project.
